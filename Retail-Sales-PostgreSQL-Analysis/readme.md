# üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Analysis (SQL + Excel)

## üìò Project Overview
The **Retail Sales Analysis** project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using **MySQL** and **Excel**.  
The goal was to analyze retail transactions, perform cleaning, validation, and exploratory analysis to uncover trends across customers, products, and time periods.

This project highlights **SQL proficiency**, **data-driven problem solving**, and **structured business analytics**.

## üéØ Objectives
- Import and clean sales data in **MySQL Workbench**.  
- Validate, standardize, and preprocess raw data.  
- Conduct descriptive and exploratory data analysis using SQL.  
- Identify customer patterns and category performance.  
- Prepare structured results for visualization and documentation.

## üîß Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
```sql
-- Create Database
CREATE DATABASE sql_retail_sales_analysis;

-- Create Table
CREATE TABLE r_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(15),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(15),
    quantiy INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

## 2. Data Cleaning
**Checking Dataset**
```sql

SELECT * FROM r_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM r_sales;
Removing Duplicates
sql
Copy code
WITH dupli_cte AS (
    SELECT *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY transactions_id, sale_date, sale_time, customer_id, gender, age, category, quantiy, price_per_unit, cogs, total_sale
        ) AS row_num
    FROM r_sales
)
SELECT *
FROM dupli_cte
WHERE row_num > 1; -- No duplicates found
```

**Handling Null or Blank Values**
```sql

SELECT *
FROM r_sales
WHERE 
    transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sale_date IS NULL
    OR sale_time IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantiy IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR total_sale IS NULL;

DELETE FROM r_sales
WHERE
    transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sale_date IS NULL
    OR sale_time IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantiy IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

**Standardizing Date Format**
```sql

UPDATE r_sales
SET sale_date = TO_DATE(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD');

ALTER TABLE r_sales
MODIFY COLUMN sale_date DATE;
```

## 3. Data Exploration
**General Overview**
```sql

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM r_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers FROM r_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS total_categories FROM r_sales;
SELECT SUM(total_sale) AS total_revenue FROM r_sales;
SELECT SUM(quantiy) AS total_quantity FROM r_sales;
```
**Gender-Based Sales**
```sql

SELECT gender, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM r_sales
GROUP BY gender;
```

## 4. Data Analysis & Queries

        AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date)
                     ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
    FROM r_sales
    GROUP BY 1, 2

            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS shift
    FROM r_sales
)
SELECT shift, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM shift_cte
GROUP BY shift;
```
